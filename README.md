## API Reference

This application uses the public SpaceX GraphQL API:
*   **API Explorer:** [SpaceX GraphQL Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/SpaceX-pxxbxen/variant/current/home)

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Core Technologies

*   **Flutter:** UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
*   **Dart:** Programming language used by Flutter.
*   **GraphQL:** Query language for the API, using the `graphql_flutter` package.

### Architecture

The application follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern, promoting a clear separation of concerns into three main layers:

1.  **Presentation Layer:** (Flutter Widgets, BLoCs/Cubits)
    *   Handles UI and user interaction.
    *   Uses the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management.
    *   Contains Pages (Screens) and Widgets.
2.  **Domain Layer:** (Entities, Use Cases, Abstract Repositories)
    *   Contains the core business logic and rules.
    *   Entities represent business objects (e.g., `Launch`, `Rocket`).
    *   Use Cases orchestrate data flow between Presentation and Data layers.
    *   Independent of UI and data source implementation.
3.  **Data Layer:** (Repositories Implementation, Data Sources, Models)
    *   Handles data retrieval and storage.
    *   Repositories implement interfaces defined in the Domain layer.
    *   Data Sources interact with external sources (GraphQL API, Local Storage).
    *   Models (DTOs) represent data structure from the API.

### State Management

*   **BLoC (Business Logic Component) / Cubit:** Utilized for managing the state of the application.
    *   `flutter_bloc` package is used for implementation.
    *   Handles loading, success, and error states for UI components.
    *   Events trigger state changes in BLoCs, while Cubits expose methods to emit new states.

### GraphQL Implementation

*   **`graphql_flutter` package:** Used as the GraphQL client.
*   **Structured Queries:** GraphQL queries are defined in `.dart` files, utilizing fragments for reusable fields.
*   **Efficient Data Fetching:** Pagination is implemented for launch lists.
*   **Error Handling:** API request errors are handled and displayed to the user.
*   **Caching:** The `graphql_flutter` client uses `HiveStore` for persistent caching of API responses, aiding in quicker data loads and some offline resilience.
